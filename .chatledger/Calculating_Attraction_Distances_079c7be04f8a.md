- Last modified: 2026-01-21T10:28:05Z

### USER Objective:
Analyzing Depression Diary

The user's main goal is to analyze the diary entry located at `Test/diary_entry_depression.md`. This involves reading the diary entry and the `psych-analysis` skill instructions, selecting the most suitable psychiatrist for the case, and then executing the analysis workflow. The workflow includes issue analysis, generating personal notes from the selected psychiatrist's perspective, and potentially creating a session transcript. The final output will be saved in the `Personal/` directory.

## Conversation ae2a69c4-c1d4-43a9-a6ed-8c88e08f57dd: Creating Psychiatric Analysis Skills
- Created: 2026-01-21T10:20:37Z
- Last modified: 2026-01-21T10:24:46Z

### USER Objective:
Creating Psychiatric Analysis Skills
The user's main goal is to create a set of agent skills to analyze psychiatric issues from diary entries. This includes skills for analyzing the problem, generating personal notes from a psychiatrist's perspective, simulating discussions between psychiatrists, and creating session transcripts. The system should be able to identify the most suitable psychiatrist for a given diary entry and utilize these skills to produce findings in markdown files within a 'Personal' folder. The immediate next step is to analyze `diary_entry_bipolar_mania.md` and select the best psychiatrist for it.

- Created: 2026-01-21T09:05:28Z
- Last modified: 2026-01-21T09:33:19Z

### USER Objective:
Analyze Kafka Cluster Secrets

The user wants to analyze individual secret and certificate reports for multiple Kafka clusters. The goal is to identify common and cluster-specific secrets and certificates, and to provide insights into their types and storage locations. The final output should be a comprehensive report saved as a markdown file in the `my-docs/kafka` folder.

## Conversation 12ea5272-801e-49fb-8f30-aa8b4a452915: Document Kafka Cluster Secrets
- Created: 2026-01-21T07:50:44Z
- Last modified: 2026-01-21T09:01:52Z

### USER Objective:
Document Kafka Cluster Secrets
The user's main objective is to create a PowerShell script named `create_secret_docs.ps1` in the `Kafka` directory. This script will automate the creation of markdown documentation templates for secrets and certificates for each Kafka cluster. It needs to identify cluster names from `.md` files in `Kafka/CLUSTER/INFO`, create a `Kafka/CLUSTER/SECRETS` directory if it doesn't exist, and then generate a markdown file for each cluster (e.g., `p-kaf-001-secrets.md`) within the `SECRETS` directory. Each generated markdown file must include sections for "Secrets" and "Certificates", along with the respective `kubectl get secrets` and `kubectl get certificates` commands, and a placeholder for pasting the command output. The script should not overwrite existing documentation files.

## Conversation 3781fc27-db36-46cf-9e2e-1881527926c2: Investigate Kafka Certificates
- Created: 2026-01-21T07:29:47Z
- Last modified: 2026-01-21T07:34:39Z

### USER Objective:
Investigate Kafka Certificates
The user's main objective is to understand the use of certificates in the Auxal Kafka setup. This involves analyzing the `Kafka/GIT/axual-kafka-prod/trd/streaming/values.yaml` file to identify certificate mentions, explaining their usage and purpose, providing methods for further investigation, clarifying the distinction between certificates and secrets, and determining their storage location. All findings must be compiled into a markdown report named `certificates_report.md` and saved in the `my-docs/kafka` directory.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<artifact_reminder>
You have not yet created any artifacts. Please follow the artifact guidelines and create them as needed based on the task.
CRITICAL REMINDER: remember that user-facing artifacts should be AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. Keep this in mind when editing artifacts.
</artifact_reminder>
<no_active_task_reminder>
You are currently not in a task because: a task boundary has never been set yet in this conversation.
If there is no obvious task from the user or if you are just conversing, then it is acceptable to not have a task set. If you are just handling simple one-off requests, such as explaining a single file, or making one or two ad-hoc code edit requests, or making an obvious refactoring request such as renaming or moving code into a helper function, it is also acceptable to not have a task set.
Otherwise, you should use the task_boundary tool to set a task if there is one evident.
Remember that task boundaries should correspond to the artifact task.md, if you have not created the artifact task.md, you should do that first before setting the task_boundary. Remember that task names should be granular and correspond to top-level checklist items, not the entire user request as one task name. If you decide to use the task boundary tool, you must do so concurrently with other tools.
Since you are NOT in an active task section, DO NOT call the `notify_user` tool unless you are requesting review of files.

If you decide to use the task boundary tool, you must do so concurrently with other tools.
Since you are NOT in an active task section, DO NOT call the `notify_user` tool unless you are requesting review of files.
You have called 2 tools in a row without calling the task_boundary tool. If you feel you are handling a non-trivial task that would involve more tool calls or research, then you should set the task boundary as a parallel tool call while you continue working on what you're doing.

### Thinking

**Advancing Toward the Goal**

I'm now focused on the best way to move forward. I'm carefully considering how to make progress towards the next stage. I'm weighing up the options to ensure the approach is efficient and well-directed. I'm aiming for the best path to reach the objective.


**Planning the Next Steps**

I'm now thinking about how to get the specific data needed to complete the task. I'm focusing on the best strategy to acquire the necessary information. I'm considering different methods to streamline the process, aiming for the most efficient path forward.


**Determining Routing Strategies**

I am now evaluating the best approach to find walking and transit times. I am focused on leveraging an open API for routing to get walking distances and times. I'm also considering how to best handle public transport data, since it's the more complex part of this task.


**Evaluating Routing Options**

I'm now determining how to proceed with finding the travel times and distances, and am making progress with geocoding the addresses. I'm prioritizing the use of an open API for routing and will be working on how to best handle public transport information. I am moving forward with getting the walking route information.


**Calculating Travel Times**

I'm now focusing on calculating travel times between locations. I plan to use a combination of methods: obtaining walking distances via a dedicated service and rough estimates or potentially manual web searches for transit information, as needed. I'm checking the data source usage limits, since there's a limit for that part of the process. I am writing code to process the addresses in the source data.


**Executing the Script**

I am now proceeding with executing the script to calculate the travel distances. I'm aiming for a rapid iteration and I'm focused on verifying the script's installation requirements. The plan is to get the results quickly and efficiently.


**Preparing to Run Script**

I'm now generating the necessary script. I'm focused on creating a Python script to calculate the travel distances efficiently. I plan to present this script for review and potentially run it, optimizing for minimal manual intervention to get the required data. I am generating code for a process.


**Drafting the Script**

I'm now writing and preparing the python script. The focus is now on implementing the calculations I've planned, with the aim of minimizing the need for manual inputs. I'll need user approval for the execution of the script. The goal is to generate the results in an efficient manner.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Writing Python script to geocode and calculate distances using OSRM, and preparing to run it." task_summary:"Goal: Create distances.csv with walking distance, walking time, transit time, and transit price from the hotel to each attraction." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 0 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.
YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously.

**Initiating Step-by-Step Action**

I'm now focused on breaking down the next steps for progress, meticulously evaluating the required actions to move forward effectively. I'm prioritizing efficient approaches and carefully considering dependencies to ensure a smooth flow toward completion. I'm thinking through possible bottlenecks to optimize the progression.


**Refining Path Forward**

I'm now honing in on the most streamlined method for gathering the required data, recognizing a simpler approach may be more appropriate than initially planned. I'm focusing on minimizing complexity and maximizing direct progress. I'm working to consolidate the approach.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Waiting for script to finish fetching and processing all 35 addresses..." task_summary:"Wrote Python script `calc_distances.py` to calculate walking and transit distances using OSRM." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 3 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.

### Thinking

**Advancing Toward the Goal**

I'm now focused on the best way to move forward. I'm carefully considering how to make progress towards the next stage. I'm weighing up the options to ensure the approach is efficient and well-directed. I'm aiming for the best path to reach the objective.


**Analyzing Command Status**

I am now thoroughly analyzing the output from the current process to ensure accurate interpretation. I'm carefully examining the returned status to understand why the duration wait was cut short. The goal is to determine the correct interpretation of the results to accurately assess progress. I am focused on ensuring the logic is correct.


**Investigating a Possible Issue**

I'm now investigating a possible issue with the current process, suspecting it might be stuck or encountering delays. I am considering different approaches to diagnose the issue and ensure the process continues smoothly. I'm focused on determining whether a rate limit or another problem is causing the delay, and I'm deciding how to address it.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Terminating slow script and rewriting it to be faster with timeouts." task_summary:"Wrote Python script `calc_distances.py` to calculate walking and transit distances using OSRM." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 2 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.
YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously.
</active_task_reminder>

<artifact_reminder>
You have not yet created any artifacts. Please follow the artifact guidelines and create them as needed based on the task.
CRITICAL REMINDER: remember that user-facing artifacts should be AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. Keep this in mind when editing artifacts.

Otherwise, you should use the task_boundary tool to set a task if there is one evident.
Remember that task boundaries should correspond to the artifact task.md, if you have not created the artifact task.md, you should do that first before setting the task_boundary. Remember that task names should be granular and correspond to top-level checklist items, not the entire user request as one task name. If you decide to use the task boundary tool, you must do so concurrently with other tools.
Since you are NOT in an active task section, DO NOT call the `notify_user` tool unless you are requesting review of files.
You have called 5 tools in a row without calling the task_boundary tool. This is extremely unexpected. Since you are doing so much work without active engagement with the user, for the next response or tool call you do please concurrently set the task boundary in parallel before continuing any further.

**Refining Address Processing**

I am now focusing on refining the address processing logic. The aim is to make the tool more robust in handling varied address formats to improve the success rate of finding attractions. The main focus is to handle the cases where specific addresses fail. This requires handling potential issues and ensuring that the geocoding step is improved to accept different inputs.


**Correcting Coordinate Handling**

I'm now zeroing in on an important detail: fixing how coordinates are handled. I have identified a mismatch in the order that latitude and longitude are passed between functions. I'm adjusting the code to ensure the correct order, which is crucial for the routing calculations to be accurate. The aim is to eliminate this potential source of error.

**Initiating Stepwise Approach**

I am now focusing on determining the most effective method for progressing to the next stage. I'm assessing how to best achieve the goals. My priority is efficient and accurate advancement through the current problem.


**Refining Output Interpretation**

I am now closely examining the output to pinpoint the cause of the previous errors. I am meticulously analyzing the results to determine why certain values were marked as unavailable. This involves checking the data to understand the root cause of the missing values.


**Investigating API Failures**

I'm now diagnosing the root cause of the `N/A` values, I'm specifically looking into why the routing API might have failed repeatedly. I'm focusing on why a crucial API for walking route information is behaving unpredictably. The API failure has been pinpointed, and I'm examining its potential root causes.


**Adjusting Request Timeout**

I'm now implementing an adjustment to the request timeout. The goal is to account for potential delays from the routing service. This change aims to improve the reliability of the responses by allowing more time for the requests to complete.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Updating the Python script to have better error handling and fallback geocoding strategies." task_summary:"Found that the OSRM API was timing out due to a short timeout and geocode was failing for some addresses. I'm updating the script with better fallbacks and longer timeouts." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 1 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.
YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously.
</active_task_reminder>

<artifact_reminder>
You have not yet created any artifacts. Please follow the artifact guidelines and create them as needed based on the task.
CRITICAL REMINDER: remember that user-facing artifacts should be AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. Keep this in mind when editing artifacts.

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Waiting for distance script to finish running, currently halfway through the list." task_summary:"Updated `calc_distances.py` with 15s timeouts, error logging, and a fallback to name-based geocoding." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 4 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.

### Thinking

**Initiating Task Execution**

I'm now proceeding with the next stage. My aim is to make definitive strides towards the final goal. I am moving to the subsequent component of the process to ensure I complete the task efficiently.


**Refining Data Interpretation**

I'm now investigating potential discrepancies in the output data. It seems there are inconsistencies regarding the distance and time calculations for one specific data point. I am now examining how these errors impact the overall dataset to refine the calculations.


**Adjusting Coordinate Handling**

I'm now tracing a data discrepancy to a potential mix-up. My focus is now on ensuring proper coordinate order when making API calls. The script's handling of latitude and longitude needs to be checked.


**Validating Duration Calculations**

I am now thoroughly checking the accuracy of the duration calculations. A discrepancy has surfaced, and my aim is to pin down the source. I'm scrutinizing how the script processes and formats the time data. I need to make certain that the output reflects the time accurately.


**Verifying Time Conversion**

I am now troubleshooting the time formatting function to identify a discrepancy. The objective is to determine why the calculated duration doesn't match the expected output. I am scrutinizing the calculations to ensure accuracy.


**Confirming Data Accuracy**

I am now focusing on data accuracy, comparing results from various sources. I need to be absolutely certain the durations are correct, and I will be looking closely at the units involved. It's time to refine the interpretations and ensure the outputs are perfectly accurate.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Fixing the transit time and distance calculations." task_summary:"The generated `distances.csv` had incorrect walking times (too fast) because OSRM returns driving speeds, and one location geocoded to another continent." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 2 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.
YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously.

<artifact_reminder>
You have not yet created any artifacts. Please follow the artifact guidelines and create them as needed based on the task.
CRITICAL REMINDER: remember that user-facing artifacts should be AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE. Keep this in mind when editing artifacts.

### Thinking

**Initiating Stepwise Approach**

I am now focusing on determining the most effective method for progressing to the next stage. I'm assessing how to best achieve the goals. My priority is efficient and accurate advancement through the current problem.


**Refining Geocoding Process**

I'm now revising how I'll handle geographical data to avoid errors. The main focus is to ensure location searches are correctly interpreted by systematically adding the country of interest to each query. This should prevent misinterpretations and ensure accurate results, and should avoid further geocoding and travel duration problems.

**Initiating Task Execution**

I'm now proceeding with the next stage. My aim is to make definitive strides towards the final goal. I am moving to the subsequent component of the process to ensure I complete the task efficiently.


**Updating Calculation Logic**

I'm now focusing on refining the duration and time calculations within the file. I am modifying the relevant sections to ensure the duration is consistently derived from the calculated distance, updating the walking speed calculation.

Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Waiting for the script to finish geocoding remaining locations and building distances.csv." task_summary:"Fixed the walking duration calculations and the geocoding logic to correctly append ", Austria". Running the final calculation script." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 2 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.
YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Waiting for Python script to finish geocoding remaining locations and building distances.csv." task_summary:"The python script is still running. I am waiting for it to finish and generate distances.csv." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 4 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.
YOUR CURRENT MODE IS: AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION. Make sure to embody this mindset as explained in your system prompt. Take this very seriously.

ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'. </bash_command_reminder>
<active_task_reminder>Remember to update the task as appropriate. The current task is: task_name:"Calculate Distances" task_status:"Finishing distance calculations and reviewing output." task_summary:"The script is finishing up the last few attractions, with some OSRM timeouts observed." mode:AGENT_MODE_EXECUTION
As a rule of thumb, you should update the status and summary around once every 5 tools. You have not updated the task in 1 tools since the last update. You should make task boundary updates concurrently with other tools when starting new work phases, STARTING with the task boundary tool if calling multiple.
Do not update the status too frequently, leave at minimum two tool calls in between status updates. Too frequent updates will overwhelm the user. Never make two status updates in a row without doing anything in between.
If you are going to either update the task boundary OR update the artifact task.md file you should do so concurrently with other tools, starting with the task boundary before calling other tools. When using the task boundary if you are going to use the same task name / task status / task summary as the current task use <SAME> as the argument value for the corresponding field instead.
CRITICAL REMINDER: The TaskStatus argument for task boundary should describe the NEXT STEPS, NOT the previous steps. The TaskSummary is used to describe the previous steps.
REMEMBER: since you are in the middle of a task, the user WILL NOT SEE ANY OF YOUR MESSAGES. THE ONLY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE USER IS VIA THE notify_user TOOL.

<bash_command_reminder> CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless  absolutely needed.  (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing.
